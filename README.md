  ## Abstract
  This repository examines image steganography using VAEs and GANs techniques. It evaluates their compatibility, image quality preservation, and efficiency. VAEs are employed for data concealment through encoding and decoding processes, while GANs utilize adversarial networks to generate hidden data. The study compares them, with VAEs known for their user-friendliness and efficiency, and GANs for their adaptability and enhanced security. GANs are specifically used to hide text behind images, while VAEs are used to hide images behind images. This research contributes to data security in digital images
