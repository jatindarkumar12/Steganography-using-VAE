  ## Abstract
  This repository examines image steganography using VAEs and GANs techniques. It evaluates their compatibility, image quality preservation, and efficiency. VAEs are employed for data concealment through encoding and decoding processes, while GANs utilize adversarial networks to generate hidden data. The study compares them, with VAEs known for their user-friendliness and efficiency, and GANs for their adaptability and enhanced security. GANs are specifically used to hide text behind images, while VAEs are used to hide images behind images. This research contributes to data security in digital images
  ## Introduction
  
This research project delves into the realm of image steganography, aiming to enhance data confidentiality by innovatively concealing and revealing information within digital images. Through the fusion of cutting-edge steganographic methodologies and digital image properties, our objective is to establish highly secure communication channels. This comprehensive exploration encompasses aspects of data security, image processing, and cryptography, aiming to contribute both theoretically and practically to the field. The ultimate goal is to empower individuals and organizations with advanced tools for secure data concealment and extraction in real-world scenarios.
